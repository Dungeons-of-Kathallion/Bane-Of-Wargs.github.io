    <p>The planned game engine is currently in progress, and for the most of it done. The vanilla gameplay is not ready at all by you could always create your own mod!. If you're interested by the game progress and development, check the wiki page about the Goals of the game.</p>
    <p>The game engine is currently at its 0.25-alpha version. As the game engine features are mainly done, the only thing to work on is <a href="https://github.com/Dungeons-of-Kathallion/Bane-Of-Wargs/wiki/Vanilla-World">The World Of Bane Of Wargs</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Dungeons-of-Kathallion/Bane-Of-Wargs/wiki/Game-Timeline-Plot">Game Timeline Plot</a>.</p>
